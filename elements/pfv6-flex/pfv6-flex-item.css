/**
 * pfv6-flex-item component CSS (Shadow DOM disabled)

 * This file is imported by the component but remains minimal/empty
 * because pfv6-flex-item does NOT use Shadow DOM.
 *
 * All actual styles are in pfv6-flex-lightdom.css, which users
 * must include in their HTML.
 *
 * This file exists only as a placeholder to satisfy the component's
 * import statement.
